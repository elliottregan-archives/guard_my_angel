    <p>&#8216;Guard My Angel&#8217; can assist you when you need the comfort of knowing that someone will help you contact your loved ones in the case of an emergency situation, without causing them anxiety of worrying about you in the case you don&#8217;t actually end up needing any help.</p>
    <p>If you get into a worrisome situation, you can trigger the service with a click of a button. Once the service is started, we will escort you on your way by tracking your mobile device until you reach comfort and safety and deliberately stop the session. In an emergency scenario, the service will trigger notifications to the relevant people you set up in advance via SMS, email and/or Facebook posts.</p>
    <p>The service <em>will not disclose</em> the information collected from the users unless they indeed reach a situation where they may need help. All the information that was collected is removed from our servers after 24 hours and cannot be retrieved so you can rely on your <em>privacy</em> being maintained!</p>
    <p>When the service is active, your contacts will get a notification, <em><u>even if the mobile device breaks, stolen, or shuts down.</em></u></p>
    <p>The notified contacts will be able to see a map that will point them to your last location as well as more information about your trip from the point you activated &#8216;Guard My Angel&#8217;.  The information will be updated periodically for a period of up to 4 hours or until the user deliberately stops the session indicating that he or she is OK.</p>
    <p>The service also includes an SOS button that triggers the notifications to your contacts the moment you press it.</p>
    <p>And &#8211; it&#8217;s <em>FREE</em>!</p>
